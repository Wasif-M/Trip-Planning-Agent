**Important Notes & Money-Saving Tips:**

*   **Book in Advance:** Book flights, accommodation, and popular attractions (like the Tower of London and West End shows) well in advance to secure better prices and availability.
*   **Travel Off-Season:** Consider traveling during the shoulder season (April-May or September-October) for lower prices and fewer crowds.
*   **Free Activities:** Take advantage of London's many free museums and parks.
*   **Oyster Card/Contactless:** Use an Oyster card or contactless payment for cheaper travel on public transport.
*   **Walk:** Walk whenever possible to save money and see more of the city.
*   **Picnics:** Pack your own lunch and snacks to save money on food.
*   **Pubs:** Pubs offer relatively affordable meals compared to restaurants.
*   **Free Walking Tours:** Take advantage of free walking tours (tip-based) to learn about the city's history and see the sights.
*   **Check for Discounts:** Look for student, senior, or other discounts on attractions and activities. Websites like "Visit London" often have deals.
*   **Consider a London Pass:** If you plan to visit many attractions, a London Pass could save you money (but do the math to see if it's worth it).
*   **Accommodation Alternatives:** Consider staying in areas slightly outside of central London (e.g., Zone 2 or 3) for cheaper accommodation.
*   **Meal Deals:** Take advantage of supermarket meal deals for lunch.
