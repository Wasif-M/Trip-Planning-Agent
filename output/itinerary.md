Okay, here's your insider's guide to London for a 4-day trip in late June 2025:

**Weather Considerations:** Expect warm weather! Pack light clothing, sunscreen, and a hat. Since there's a chance of rain on two days, a light, packable raincoat or umbrella is a good idea. Stay hydrated, especially with the higher temperatures predicted.

**Safety First:** London is generally safe, but be vigilant, especially in crowded tourist areas.

*   **Pickpockets:** Keep your belongings close and be aware of your surroundings, especially on the Tube and at major attractions.
*   **Phone Snatching:** Be particularly careful with your phone. Avoid using it near roads or in crowded areas where thieves on mopeds or bikes might operate.
*   **Terrorism:** While the risk is present, don't let it paralyze you. Be aware of your surroundings and report anything suspicious to the authorities.

**Getting Around:**

*   **Oyster Card/Contactless:** The Tube is your best friend. Get an Oyster card or use contactless payment (credit/debit card or phone) for easy travel on the Tube, buses, and trams.
*   **Walking:** London is a great city for walking, especially between attractions in the same area.
*   **Buses:** A scenic way to get around, but can be slower than the Tube, especially during rush hour.
*   **River Bus:** A unique way to see the city from the Thames.
*   **Taxis/Ride-Sharing:** Convenient but can be expensive, especially during peak times.

**Cultural Etiquette & Local Customs:**

*   **Queuing:** The British love to queue! Always line up and wait your turn patiently.
*   **"Please" and "Thank You":** Politeness goes a long way. Use "please" and "thank you" frequently.
*   **Personal Space:** Respect personal space, especially on public transport.
*   **Tipping:** 10-15% is customary in restaurants and for taxi rides.
*   **Mind the Gap:** A classic London phrase! Be careful when stepping on and off the Tube.
*   **Pub Culture:** Pubs are a central part of London life. It's customary to order drinks at the bar. Buying a round for your friends is a nice gesture.
*   **Slang:** Learn a few basic phrases like "cheers" (thank you/goodbye), "loo" (toilet), "cuppa" (cup of tea).
